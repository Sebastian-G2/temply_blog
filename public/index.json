You’re proud of your design, but you have a nagging feeling that you’re losing visitors with every second they spend waiting for your page to load. It’s one of the most frustrating problems for any Carrd creator: a site that looks great but performs poorly. The good news? There’s a quick fix you can apply right now to solve a huge part of the problem.\nThe Value: Your Quick Win for a Faster Site # The biggest culprit for slow-loading websites is almost always unoptimized images. Your stunning, high-resolution background image might look amazing, but it could also be several megabytes in size. Sending that much data over the internet takes time.\nHere’s a simple, free, and effective way to fix it. We\u0026rsquo;re going to compress your images before you upload them to Carrd.\nYour 5-Minute Action Plan:\nGo to TinyPNG.com. This free tool is my go-to for quick and powerful image compression. It reduces file sizes significantly without a noticeable drop in quality. Upload Your Images. Drag and drop the images you\u0026rsquo;re using on your Carrd site onto the page. You can do up to 20 at a time. Download the Compressed Files. TinyPNG will work its magic and give you a download link for the much smaller image files. Re-upload to Carrd. Go back to your Carrd editor, remove the old, heavy images, and replace them with the new, lightweight ones you just downloaded. Publish your changes. That’s it. You’ve just taken a major step toward a faster website. This single action can dramatically improve your loading times, and it’s a crucial piece of website maintenance everyone should be doing.\nThe Gap: Why Your Site Is Still Not Fast Enough # Feeling good? You should. You just fixed a major performance issue.\nBut if you\u0026rsquo;re serious about performance, I have to be honest: what you just did is only about 10% of the solution. It\u0026rsquo;s the low-hanging fruit. True, professional-grade speed optimization goes much deeper, and this is where Carrd\u0026rsquo;s simplicity starts to show its limitations.\nHere’s what’s really holding your site back:\nNo Lazy Loading: By default, Carrd loads every single image on your page the moment a visitor arrives, even the ones at the very bottom they may never see. A professional site \u0026ldquo;lazy loads\u0026rdquo; images, meaning they only load right before they scroll into view. This makes the initial page load incredibly fast. Third-Party Scripts: That cool Mailchimp form, your Gumroad embed, or your analytics tracker? They are fantastic tools, but they often load external code that can seriously slow down your site. Optimizing them requires careful handling and sometimes custom code to prevent them from bottlenecking your performance. Modern Image Formats: Did you know there are new image formats like WebP that are about 30% smaller than JPEG or PNG files at the same quality? Google loves them, and they make sites fly. The problem? Carrd doesn’t support them natively. Implementing them requires custom workarounds that are far from straightforward. Trying to tackle these issues yourself involves diving into custom code, dealing with broken embeds, and spending hours on forums—the very complexity you chose Carrd to avoid.\nThe Bridge: The Expert Solution for a Lightning-Fast Site # You chose Carrd for its simplicity and power. You shouldn\u0026rsquo;t have to become a web performance engineer to get the results you need.\nThis is exactly why I created the \u0026ldquo;Built for You\u0026rdquo; service at Temply.studio.
